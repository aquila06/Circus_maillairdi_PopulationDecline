# Circus_maillairdi_PopulationDecline
This is a repository aimed at storing the scripts and data of a manuscript entitled "Long-term population monitoring reveals an alarming decline in the endangered endemic Reunion Harrier Circus maillardi"  



It contains:
* a .RData file with the necessary objects to run the models and to create the figures included in the MS, as well as the different models that have been fitted.
* a R script file, compute_spatio_temp_trends_gam_vcov.r, which contains  2 home-made functions:
   compute_distri which computes temporal variations of an abundance index values based on a mgcv::gam() model, a data.frame containing variables for predictions, a time variable and possibily a grouping factor (such as a pixel index to spatialise predictions on a grid. This fuction return a list of predicted values of abundance for each level of the grouping factor, at the different values specified for the time variable
  compute_trends which, from the list generated by the above function, compute the trends between a specified values ystart and yend, for the beginning and the end of the period to consider. If a grouping factor has been specified in compute_distri, it must specified in this function.
* R scripts to run the models and generate the figures
